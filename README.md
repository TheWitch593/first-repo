# 🌟 My Codédex Git & GitHub Adventure 🌟

Hey there, curious coder! 👋  
Welcome to my little GitHub playground, where I’m learning the magical powers of **Git** and **GitHub** through the ✨ **Codédex** ✨ course!

## 🧭 What’s This Repo All About?

This repository is a collection of my progress and practice from the **Codédex Git & GitHub** course.  
It’s where I:

- 🚀 Push updates to GitHub
- 💬 Document my journey with a touch of style!

## 🌸 What You'll Find

- `README.md` — this file right here!
- 💡 Learning checkpoints
- 🔁 Commit history full of tiny victories
- A little sprinkle of fun in every folder 💖

## 💬 Let’s Be Friends!
